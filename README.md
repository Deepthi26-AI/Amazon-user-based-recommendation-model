I have choosen the Building user-based recommendation model for Amazon.
 
INTRODUCTION:

Recommender systems help you tailor customer experiences on online platforms. Amazon Personalize is an artificial intelligence and machine learning service that specializes in developing recommender system solutions. It automatically examines the data, performs feature and algorithm selection, optimizes the model based on your data, and deploys and hosts the model for real-time recommendation inference. However, if you need to access trained modelsâ€™ weights, you may need to build your recommender system from scratch. 
Amazon currently uses item-to-item collaborative filtering, which scales to massive data sets and produces high-quality recommendations in real time. This type of filtering matches each of the user's purchased and rated items to similar items, then combines those similar items into a recommendation list for the user.

So, In this at first i downloaded the dataset and loaded it  first we need to understand the data(like using describe and info functions)to build a model or to get predictions for testset.I had performed every task given there till end.

STEPS THAT I HAD DONE:

1.importing all needed libraries
2.Data Analysis
3.Checking which movies having maximum views
4.Checking which movies having maximum ratings
5.Top 5 movies with maximum ratings
6.Top 5 movies with the least audience
7.Building recommendation Model
8.Splitting the data into train and test datasets
9.Building a recommendation model on training data
10.predictions on the test data
